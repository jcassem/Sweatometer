# Sweatometer

This project provides a series of services related to the combination of words.
The concept of 'sweat' in this context is a measure of how hard a pun/combination of words
has to work to be figured out and/or considered punny.

The main service this webapp aims to provide is the Sweatometer itself, which will take in
your word equation (word1 + word2 = yourCraftedWord), evaluate it, and return a score based on
how sweaty it is.

This service is reliant on the [Data Muse API](http://www.datamuse.com/api), which provides a series 
of word services.


## Technology
